# LAB-3

## Instructions
For this lab, I would like you to take the math.java file from notes, and extend it with additional methods/functions.

When doing this, I would like you to not add or subtract more than 1 at a time on a line.  I would also like you not to use opperators other than + and -, and the methods/functions we have created in this file.


Please implement:
* multiplication function
* division funcion
* modulo function
* a string concatination function (that takes two strings and returns the second appended to the first
* a string repeating function that takes a string and a number (that returns the number of times to repeat printing it out)
